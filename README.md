**UIShaderGraphSample** is a Unity project showing how to implement custom UI shaders using Shader Graph.

With the addition of the new UI Canvas material type in Unity 2023.2, you can implement custom UI shaders using Shader Graph. This sample project demonstrates a few simple examples of custom UI shaders with this feature.

Currently, it only supports Unity UI (UGUI).
